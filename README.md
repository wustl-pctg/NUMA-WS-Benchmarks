# NUMA-WS Benchmarks

These are a series of benchmarks to test and demonstrate the capability of the 
NUMA-WS runtime system. Read more [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11128).

## Future Changes
Currently these are *hand compiled* benchmarks with the runtime calls that manage 
the NUMA aware portions of the runtime inserted with great care. As the system
matures, these calls will likely be replaced with new syntax.
